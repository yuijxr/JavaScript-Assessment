# JavaScript-Assessment

This project implements a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) minting system in JavaScript. It allows you to create, store, and display NFTs along with their metadata.

   - A JavaScript array named `NFTs` is used to hold the NFTs.
   - The `mintNFT` function creates an object with metadata for each NFT and stores it in the `NFTs` array.
   - The `listNFTs` function iterates through the `NFTs` array and logs the metadata of each NFT to the console.
   - The `getTotalSupply` function logs the total number of minted NFTs to the console.

1. First, include the provided JavaScript code in your project.
2. Call the `mintNFT` function to mint new NFTs, providing metadata values as parameters.
3. Call the `listNFTs` function to print the metadata of all minted NFTs to the console.
4. Call the `getTotalSupply` function to get the total number of minted NFTs.
